                            My name is Malin Eriksson and I'm 31 years old. I live in a small community named Duved in JÃ¤mtland, Sweden. From my kitchen window I see the slopes of Duved and people skiing. 
                            Just like those people, I enjoy being outside both winter and summer. Nevertheless in present time alot of my days I'm spending behind my computer screen learning new interesting tech 
                            and soon I'll start a new journey working with IT in earnest.
